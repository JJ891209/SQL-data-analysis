2) To acquire new subscribers via content 

Project  is to help the community manager evaluate the effectiveness of the magazine's Facebook strategy.
The community manager is particularly interested in identifying a trend analysis over time of key indicators, such as location, gender, age, and language of their users. She is also interested in identifying the best time of day, as well as the best day of week, to publish content. Finally, she would like to assess the feasibility of launching a UK and US English version of the magazine based on the current number of bilingual fans of the page.
